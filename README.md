# Dog Breeds

This repository contains a very rudimentary example of an application to create and serve a deep learning model.  This is not production quality code, rather its used in a classroom setting to teach the basics of model serving.

## Setup
To run this repository, all that is need is docker (isn't this great!), you may also choose to train the model without docker in which case a normal Python 10 based installation with tensorflow will do just fine.
